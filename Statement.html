  <h1>Jon-Jon Rodriguez's About</h1>
  <div class="container mt-3">
<p> Beginning during my freshmen year in High School, I had the intention of enrolling </p>
<p>in an intro to animation class. I took the class as a way to improve my own skills as an </p>
<p>artist and to specifically improve my drawing skills. During my sophomore year I had a break </p>
<p>from art-wise courses to focus more on general education taking 2 art courses during my Senior </p>
<p>Year. My junior year of high school is when I started really become invested into the idea of </p>
<p>creating art for a living. With many experience of playing video games and drawing, I figured </p>
<p>that I could combine the two to create a vision for the future.</p>
<p> ____ </p>
<p>Currently as a freshmen in San Jose State University, I continue to improve my skills as a growing</p>
<p>artist. Despite not getting into the Animation & Illustration program, I've decided to get the Digital</p>
<p>Media Major due to the research of creating Computer Games. In the future as an artist, I hope to be</p>
<p>able to be involved in the development of certain video games as an artist and to create artwork that</p>
<p>could not only inspire me to make more, but to inspire others to create. I wish to create art as both</p>
<p>as a hobby, and as a living.</p>
